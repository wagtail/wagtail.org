        <p>
            Import roadmap data from
            <a href="https://github.com/wagtail/roadmap">wagtail/roadmap</a>.
            Roadmap data is retrieved from the repository's
            <a href="https://github.com/wagtail/roadmap/milestones">Milestones</a>
            (not the Projects feature). Only milestones that are in an "open" state
            will be imported.
        </p>
        <p>
            The import will copy the milestones as
            <a href="{% url 'wagtailsnippets_roadmap_milestone:list' %}">
                Roadmap Milestone
            </a>
            snippets. If instances of the milestones or issues already exist,
            they will be updated with the latest data from GitHub. Custom data
            such as the sponsorship URL will be preserved.
        </p>

            An access token is necessary to use GitHub's GraphQL API. To create an access token, see
            <a href="https://github.com/settings/tokens">Personal access tokens</a>.
            The token does not need to have any permissions configured.
